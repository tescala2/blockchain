In UniswapV3's inception, the higher fee pool was used more. As time goes on, the lower fee pool is used far more than the higher fee pool. Since we're talking about ETH, we know gas fees are quite high at times which would push users to a lower fee pool to maximize their outputs. In terms of trends, both pools coincide relatively well on high volume days with the lower fee pool around 3-5x as much volume as the higher fee pool.
